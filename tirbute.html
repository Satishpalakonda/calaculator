				Who is Sundar Pichai? 
			</h1>



<p>
				☛ Sundar Pichaiwas born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India<br><br>
				☛ Hsundar Pichai, in full Pichai Sundararajan, (born June 10, 1972, 
				          Madras [now Chennai], Tamil Nadu, India), Indian-born American executive 
						  who was CEO of both Google, Inc. (2015– ), and its holding company, Alphabet
						  Inc. (2019– )..<br><br>
				☛ As a boy growing up in Madras, Pichai slept with his brother in the
				          living room of the cramped family home, but his father, an electrical engineer
						  at the British multinational GEC, saw that the boys received a good education.<br><br>
				☛ At an early age Pichai displayed an interest in technology and an 
				          extraordinary memory, especially for telephone numbers. After earning a degree
						   in metallurgy (B.Tech., 1993) and a silver medal at the Indian Institute of 
						   Technology Kharagpur, he was awarded a scholarship to study at Stanford University
						   (M.S. in engineering and materials science, 1995).
			        ☛ He remained in the United States thereafter, working briefly for
					      Applied Materials (a supplier of semiconductor materials) and then earning an M.B.A.
						 (2002) from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.<br><br> 
                               
				<br><br> 
                                ☛ In 2011 Pichai reportedly was aggressively pursued for employment by 
								microblogging service Twitter, and in 2014 he was touted as a possible CEO
								 for Microsoft, but in both instances he was granted large financial packages 
								 to remain with Google.
				<br><br> 
                                ☛ He also was known to have helped negotiate Google’s $3.2 billion deal to acquire
								 Nest Labs in 2014. Therefore, when Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced 
								 the creation of Alphabet Inc., in August 2015, it came as no surprise to industry insiders
								  that Pichai was named CEO of Google, which was reorganized as a subsidiary. In December
								   2019 he also was named CEO of Alphabet, replacing Page, who stepped down.
